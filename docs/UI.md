# UI & Accessibility (Phase 2 web map)

Visual theming and accessibility decisions for the interactive map. Phase 1
(static PNG) is out of scope. Render/performance tradeoffs live in
`PERFORMANCE.md`; data-shape decisions in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## Current state (updated 2026-06-29)

- **Dark theme only.** No basemap (polygons on dark are self-describing — see
  ARCHITECTURE.md Phase 2 notes).
- **Three swappable colour ramps** (`RAMPS` in `index.html`, palette switcher under
  the Revenue/Value toggle), each carrying its own background + roof-edge colour:
  - **Inferno** — original warm ramp, bg `#0a0a0f`, teal edge.
  - **Glow** — near-white peak so the tallest towers glow, bg `#08060f`, cool slate
    edge (this partly addresses the "edge not finalized" item below).
  - **Cividis** — perceptually uniform + colour-blind safe (the colourblind-mode ramp;
    see "Colourblind mode" — CVD-simulator verification still pending).
  - All three are neutral luminance-sequential (magnitude = brightness, no good/bad hue).
- **Clamp is per-metric** (`colorClamp` in each `METRICS` entry): revenue `$50k`,
  value `$4M` (≈ same p97 percentile, so both saturate the top ~2.5%). **NOTE:** the
  hard clamp creates a saturated plateau that reads as a fake threshold — being
  replaced by a land-use set-aside + (likely) a log/sqrt transform; see
  `SPEC_revenue.md` (Update 2026-06-29) and `FINDINGS_revenue_scale.md`.
- **deck.gl gotcha:** colour accessors that depend on the active ramp need the ramp in
  their `updateTriggers` (the data reference is stable, so deck.gl skips the re-render
  otherwise). `getFillColor` uses `[state.metric, state.ramp]`.

### Set-aside neutral treatment (DECIDED 2026-06-29, not yet built)
Neighbourhoods that are ≥90% never/not-yet land (River Valley, parks, undeveloped —
see `SPEC_revenue.md`) render in a **neutral grey**, distinct from the ramp, so they
read as "outside the fiscal comparison" rather than as red/low. They are also excluded
from the colour-scale fit. The full zoning-polygon overlay layer is a separate later
product decision.

## Open / unresolved

- **Top-cap edge colour — NOT finalized (as of 2026-06-26).** The developer is
  not happy with it yet. Tried so far: `[120,215,255]` bright cyan (too hot) →
  `[55,130,160]` dark teal (still a touch bright) → `[40,95,120]` deep muted teal
  (current, still not right). Still iterating — don't treat the current value as
  settled. Worth considering alongside the light-mode work below, since the right
  edge colour depends on the background.

## Interaction & navigation

The map opens tilted (pitch 52°) and relies on rotation to read the 3D
extrusion, so camera control is core to the UX — not a nicety.

**Current gestures** (MapLibre defaults — nothing in `index.html` customizes the
interaction handlers):

| Action | Desktop | Mobile / touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spin / rotate (bearing) | Ctrl + drag | two-finger twist |
| Tilt (pitch) | Ctrl + drag (vertical) | two-finger drag up/down |
| Zoom | scroll | pinch |
| Pan | drag | one-finger drag |

**Gaps (as of 2026-06-26):**
- **No reset / compass control.** No `NavigationControl` is added, so there's no
  affordance to snap bearing back to north or reset pitch. A user who rotates into
  an awkward angle — easy to do on a phone — has no obvious way back.
- **Rotation is undiscoverable.** Both the desktop modifier (Ctrl) and the mobile
  two-finger twist are hidden; first-time users often don't realize the view spins
  at all, and the twist competes with pinch-zoom.

**Proposed fix:** add the standard control —
```js
map.addControl(new maplibregl.NavigationControl({ visualizePitch: true }));
```
Gives a compass (tap to reset bearing), zoom buttons, and a pitch indicator. The
compass also doubles as a visible hint that the map rotates. Cheap, idiomatic, and
helps desktop and mobile alike. Not yet added — flagged here for a UX pass.

**Wishlist (later — to design as a UX pass):**
- **Recenter / reset-view button.** Distinct from the compass: snaps the *whole*
  camera back to the default `CENTER` / zoom / pitch / bearing in one tap, not just
  bearing-to-north. Needs a custom control (store the initial camera, `flyTo` it).
- Other camera/UX niceties to gather here as they come up (e.g. preset viewpoints,
  a "what am I looking at" intro hint, keyboard shortcuts list).

## Planned (later)

### Light mode
- Needs more than flipping the background: the inferno ramp and the cool edge are
  tuned for a dark backdrop and won't read the same on light. Expect to rework
  the background, the fill ramp's dark end, and `TOP_EDGE_COLOR` together.
- **Implementation direction:** factor the colour tunables into a named theme
  object (e.g. `THEMES.dark` / `THEMES.light`) rather than loose top-level
  constants, with a toggle. Keeps the two palettes from drifting.

### Colourblind mode
- The current sequential ramp varies mostly in **luminance**, which is already
  reasonably robust for red-green CVD (deuteranopia/protanopia). The main risk is
  **tritanopia** (blue-yellow), where the warm fills + cool teal edge could lose
  separation.
- **Implementation direction:** offer a CVD-safe ramp toggle. `cividis` is
  designed specifically so red-green CVD viewers perceive it near-identically to
  normal vision — a strong default for this mode. Verify any palette against a CVD
  simulator before shipping; don't rely on eyeballing.
- Fits the same theme-object structure as light mode — treat both as palette
  variants behind one toggle.

## Principles

- **Don't rely on colour alone.** Height already encodes `value_per_acre`
  redundantly with colour — keep it that way so the map survives any palette.
- **Verify, don't eyeball, accessibility.** Use a CVD simulator and (eventually)
  a contrast check; a screenshot under normal vision proves nothing about CVD.
- **One source of palette truth.** As modes land, all colours flow from the theme
  object so dark/light/CVD stay in sync.
